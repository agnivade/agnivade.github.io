It has happened to all of us. You get into a habit and accept a few inconveniences and move on. It bothers you, but you procrastinate, putting it in the backburner by slapping that mental TODO note. Yet surprisingly, sometimes the solution is right in front of you.

Take my case. I have always done `_ "github.com/lib/pq"` in my code to use the postgres driver. Life went on and I didn't even bother to look for better ways to do things. Until the time came and I screamed "There has to be a better way !".

Indeed there was. It was the actual `pq` package, which I was already using but never _actually_ imported ! Yes, I am shaking my head too :sweat:. Stupidly, I had always looked at `database/sql` and never bothered to look at the underlying `lib/pq` package. Oh well, dumb mistakes are bound to happen. I learn from them and move on.

Let's take a look at some of the goodies that I found inside the package, and how it made my postgres queries look much leaner and elegant. :tada:

### Arrays

Let's say that you have a table like this -

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
	id serial PRIMARY KEY,
	comments text[]
);
```

Believe it or not, for the longest time, I did this to scan a postgres array -

```go
id := 1
var rawComments string
err := db.QueryRow(`SELECT comments from users WHERE id=$1`, id).Scan(&rawComments)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
comments := strings.Split(rawComments[1:len(rawComments)-1], ",")
log.Println(id, comments)
```

It was ugly. But life has deadlines and I moved on. Here is the better way -

```go
var comments []string
err := db.QueryRow(`SELECT comments from users WHERE id=$1`, id).Scan(pq.Array(&comments))
if err != nil {
	return err
}
log.Println(id, comments)
```

Similarly, to insert a row with an array -

```go
id := 3
comments := []string{"marvel", "dc"}
_, err := db.Exec(`INSERT INTO users VALUES ($1, $2)`, id, pq.Array(comments))
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

### Null Time

Consider a table like this -

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS last_updated (
	id serial PRIMARY KEY,
	ts timestamp
);
```

Now if you have an entry where `ts` is NULL, it is extremely painful to scan it in one shot. You can use `coalesce` or a CTE or something of that sort. This is how I would have done it earlier -

```go
id := 1
var ts time.Time
err := db.QueryRow(`SELECT coalesce(ts, to_timestamp(0)) from last_updated WHERE id=$1`, id).Scan(&ts)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
log.Println(id, ts, ts.IsZero()) // ts.IsZero will still be false btw !
```

This is far better :+1: -

```go
id := 1
var ts pq.NullTime
err := db.QueryRow(`SELECT ts from last_updated WHERE id=$1`, id).Scan(&ts)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
if ts.Valid {
	// do something
}
log.Println(id, ts.Time, ts.Time.IsZero()) // This is true !
```

### Errors

Structured errors are great. But the only error type check that I used to have in my tests were for `ErrNoRows` since that is the only useful error type exported by the `database/sql` package. It frustrated me to no end. Because there are so many types of DB errors like syntax errors, constraint errors, not_null errors etc. Am I forced to do the dreadful string matching ?

I made the discovery when I learnt about the `#` format specifier. Doing a `t.Logf("%+v", err)` versus `t.Logf("%#v", err)` makes a world of a difference.

If you have a key constraint error, the first would print

```
pq: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "last_updated_pkey"
```

whereas in case of latter

```
&pq.Error{Severity:"ERROR", Code:"23505", Message:"duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"last_updated_pkey\"", Detail:"Key (id)=(1) already exists.", Hint:"", Position:"", InternalPosition:"", InternalQuery:"", Where:"", Schema:"public", Table:"last_updated", Column:"", DataTypeName:"", Constraint:"last_updated_pkey", File:"nbtinsert.c", Line:"433", Routine:"_bt_check_unique"}
```

Aha. So there is an underlying `pq.Error` type. And it has error codes ! Wohoo ! Better tests !

So in this case, the way to go would be -

```go
pqe, ok := err.(*pq.Error)
if ok != true {
	t.Fatal("unexpected type")
}
if string(pqe.Code) != "23505" {
	t.Error("unexpected error code.")
}
```

And that's it ! For a more detailed look, head over to the package [documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq).
